Hello, this is my repo for learning **Python**. My focus is on getting better to eventually create [Robotframework](http://https://robotframework.org/) custom keyword methods and class libraries. Also, there is some underlying focus on getting familiar with *Machine Learning*, a topic that seems to be quite vast at a first glance :smile: .

About the repo itself
  * master branch will carry some basic stuff i have created, having files on Set, Tuples, Lists etc.
  * the folder advanced learning carries has a small command line program i made as a recruiting exercise to generate people information to the command line
  * the data analysis folder carries the stuff i am learning right now about data analysis and its uses in Machine Learning.

As of right now, thats it :smile: i am continuing to produce code again here so look forward to repos on **Robotframework** stuff and also **C++** gaming in the future :cowboy_hat_face:
